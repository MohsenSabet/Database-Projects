# Car Rental Management System Database Project

## Overview
This repository hosts the Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) and related database files for the Car Rental Management System. This system is designed to manage car rental operations, including customer management, vehicle tracking, reservations, and rentals.

## Components
- **ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagram):** Visual representation of the database schema, illustrating the system's entities, relationships, and key constraints.
- **Database Schema:** Scripts for creating the database schema, including tables for customers, vehicles, rentals, reservations, and more.
- **Data Seeding Scripts:** Sample data to populate the database for testing and development purposes.
- **Documentation:** Detailed explanation of the system's database design, entity descriptions, and relationship mappings.

## Features
- **Customer Management:** Tracks customer details, including contact information and rental history.
- **Vehicle Inventory:** Manages vehicle details, such as make, model, status, and current location.
- **Rental and Reservation System:** Facilitates the booking, renting, and return processes.
- **Promotions and Discounts:** Supports the application of promotions and discounts to rentals.

## Getting Started
To set up the database for the Car Rental Management System:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Execute the schema creation scripts in your preferred database management system (DBMS) to create the database structure.
3. Run the data seeding scripts to populate the database with initial data.
4. Refer to the documentation for a detailed overview of the system and database design.

## Database Setup
- **SQL Scripts:** Contains all necessary SQL scripts for creating tables, relationships, and inserting initial data into the database. Follow these steps to set up your database:
  1. **Schema Creation:** Execute the `schema.sql` script to create the database structure, including all tables and relationships.
  2. **Data Seeding:** Use the `seed.sql` script to populate the database with initial data, providing a rich dataset for development and testing.
  3. **Queries and Procedures:** Additional scripts for common queries and stored procedures are also included, enhancing the system's functionality.

Ensure to run these scripts in the order mentioned to avoid any dependency issues.
